Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive copyright and related rights ("Copyright") upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) ("Owner") of an original work of authorship and
related material ("Work").  From time to time, Owners wish to permanently
dedicate their Copyright and Related Rights to a work so that others may
use, share, and build upon that work without restriction under copyright
law.  A public domain dedication is the best way to accomplish this goal,
but in some jurisdictions legal difficulties may prevent the Work from
being dedicated to the public domain.  To address this, Creative Commons
provides the CC0 public domain dedication which nullifies copyright
claims to the greatest extent possible under the law.

The person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work
to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work
worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring
rights, to the extent allowed by law.

You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for
commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
